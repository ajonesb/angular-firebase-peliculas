## Angular Peliculas Integrated with Firebase Database

## Install Angular CLI

`npm install @angular/cli -g`

## Install NPM

`npm install`

## Update Angular

`ng update @angular/cli @angular/core`

## Install latest version of Angular Material

`ng add @angular/material`

## Bootstrap

`npm install bootstrap jquery popper` 

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build --prod` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

- NOTE: You would not be able to view the index.html file on the dist folder. In order to view the content from the index.html, you must deploy to a server or install a server. 

- In this case, I just deployed directly to my hosting all the files on the dist folder to a sub folder (jonesfrontendwebdev.com/sub-folder) 

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
